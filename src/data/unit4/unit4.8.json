            "question": "The emergence of the German industries referred to in the passage is most directly explained by which of the following processes in the nineteenth century?",
            "passage_header": "Harold Baron, British historian, book describing the chemical industry of Europe, published in 1909",
            "passage": "“By the end of the nineteenth century, Germany had advanced beyond Britain in terms of economic output. The prime reason for this development was that Germany developed newer industries, while Britain continued to stress textile production. Formerly an agricultural country, the German Empire has come to be regarded as one of the leading industrial nations of the world and, in the chemical industries, Germany has for some time occupied a leading place. One of the most successful chemical and pharmaceutical firms in Germany is the Bayer company. Bayer employs 3,500 people alone at its plant in Leverkusen, and the factory is so gigantic that all of these people are barely noticed when a visitor tours it. The laboratories are arranged very much in the same manner as the university laboratories in Britain. Each workstation receives a supply of electricity, compressed air, steam, and hot and cold water. The research chemists are paid a salary of about 100 British pounds for the first year. If a chemist has shown himself to be useful in his first year, he may receive a longer contract and may receive royalties on any processes that he invented.”",

            "explanation": "The passage describes the emergence of the German chemical industry in the late nineteenth century. The passage notes that Germany had advanced beyond Britain in terms of economic output because Germany developed newer industries, while Britain continued to stress textile production. The passage also notes that Germany has come to be regarded as one of the leading industrial nations of the world and that Germany has occupied a leading place in the chemical industries. The passage also notes that the Bayer company is one of the most successful chemical and pharmaceutical firms in Germany.

            "question": "The industrialization of Great Britain’s economy in the mid-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is most directly explained by which of the following?",
            "answers": [
                "Britain had large reserves of petroleum.",
                "British scientists were the first to discover electricity.",
                "Britain had large reserves of coal.",
                "British engineers developed new methods of producing cheaper steel."
            ],
            "explanation": "The industrialization of Great Britain’s economy in the mid-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was most directly explained by the fact that Britain had large reserves of coal. Coal was a key factor in the industrialization of Great Britain’s economy because it was used as a fuel source to power steam engines and other machinery. The availability of coal allowed British manufacturers to produce goods more efficiently and at a lower cost, which helped to drive the industrial revolution in Great Britain.",
