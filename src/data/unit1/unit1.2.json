            ],
            "explanation": "The table shows a significant increase in China’s population from 200 to 1000 CE. The population increase was due to a number of factors, including the introduction of new crop strains, iron plows, and expanded irrigation. These technological innovations led to an increase in agricultural output, which in turn led to a population increase. Additionally, less warfare with neighboring states and nomadic peoples meant fewer casualties in wars, which also contributed to the population increase. The Confucian emphasis on the importance of family also led many Chinese to have more children, further contributing to the population increase.",
