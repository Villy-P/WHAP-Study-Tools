            ],
            "explanation": "The introduction of Champa rice into China during the eleventh century led to a population increase in China. This population increase was due to the fact that Champa rice was drought resistant and could be harvested twice a year. This led to a population increase in China, which in turn led to a greater demand for food. This demand for food led to the stimulation of agriculture by technological innovation.",
